Jubelio chat is a chat application aimed for online store sellers, making it easier for sellers to reply chats from customers because chat in various e-commerce can be done in just one app, namely jubelio chat. Examples of e-commerce that can be integrated with jubelio chat are like: Shopee, Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Blibli and Lazada.

Work on the jubelio chat aggregator project is done in a team, and our team specifically works on the frontend. I myself handle the setting up i18n section for language switching in the app, setting up sqlite database, and some component store builds such as shopee and lazada.

The duration of the project is 2 months (November 2020 - December 2020)
