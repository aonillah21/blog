IO-Project is an e-learning application that is used by employees of PT Padepokan Tujuh Sembilan to improve their knowledge and skills in programming. This application is also used for bootcamp activities for new talents joining PT Padepokan Tujuh Sembilan.

In the development of this application, I contribute as a technical leader at the front end by preparing a project framework, the project directory, the library that will be used, as well as helping with development during the sprint.

Working report project took 5 months, from July 2019 to November 2019.
