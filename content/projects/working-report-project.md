Working report is an application to collect information about the work of all employees at PT Padepokan Tujuh Sembilan. The main purpose of this working report application is to monitor the monthly work activities of employees so that it can be seen whether the employee is eligible for a salary for that month.

In the development of this application, I contribute as a technical leader at the front end by preparing a project framework from the project directory, the library that will be used, as well as helping with bug fixing when itâ€™s finished loading.

The project working report took 6 months, from December 2020 to May 2021.
